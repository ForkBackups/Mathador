This is a simplistic implementation of some aspects of the Mathematica Language in C++. The main program is in Mathador.cpp and yields an interactive console program to enter queries.

Supported functions:

Basic arithmetic: Plus (+), Subtract (-), Minus (-), Times (*), Divide (/), Power (^), NonCommutativeMultiply (**), Abs

Elementary Functions: Sin, Cos

Numeric Evaluation: N

Lists: List, Length

Assignment: Set (=), SetDelayed (:=), UpSet (^=), UpSetDelayed (^:=), Increment (++), PreIncrement (++)

Tests: Equal (==), Unequal (!=), Less (<), Greater (>), LessEqual (<=), GreaterEqual (>=)

Logical operations: Not (!), And (&&), Or (||)

Flow control: CompoundExpression (;), If, For

Attributes: Attributes, SetAttributes, ClearAttributes

Evaluation control: Unevaluated

Expression structure: Head, FullForm

Functional operations: Function (&), Slot (#), SlotSequence (##), Apply (@@), Map (/@)

Pattern matching: Pattern (:), Blank (_), BlankSequence (__), BlankNullSequence (___), MatchQ

Rule application: Rule (->), RuleDelayed (:>), Replace, ReplaceAll (/.), ReplaceRepeated (//.)

Scoping: Module
